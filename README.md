This repo contains a dump of Tronxy-XY2 (non-PRO) firmware [tronxy.bin](tronxy.bin). 
I used [Flasher-stm32](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/flasher-stm32.html) for dumping and upload, since STM Cube Programming is VERY unstable (at least for me).

It also has the configurations used to create a compatible Marlin firmware for this printer.
